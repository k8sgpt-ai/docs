    ```bash
    k8sgpt analyze --explain --backend localai
    ```

## FakeAI

FakeAI or the NoOpAiProvider might be useful in situations where you need to test a new feature or simulate the behaviour of an AI based-system without actually invoking it. It can help you with local development, testing and troubleshooting.
The NoOpAiProvider does not actually perform any AI-based operations but simulates them by echoing the input given as a problem.

Follow the steps outlined below to learn how to utilize the NoOpAiProvider:

- Authorize k8sgpt with `noopai` or `noop` as the Backend Provider:
    ```
    k8sgpt auth -b noopai
    ```
- For the auth token, you can leave it blank as the NoOpAiProvider is configured to work fine with or without any token.

- Use the analyze and explain command to check for errors in your kubernetes cluster and the NoOpAiProvider should return the error as the solution itself:
    ```
    k8sgpt analyze --explain --backend noopai
    ```
