## Common Issues

### Windows WSL
Failing Installation on WSL or Linux (missing gcc)
When installing Homebrew on WSL or Linux, you may encounter the following error:

```bash
==> Installing k8sgpt from k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt Error: The following formula cannot be installed from bottle and must be
built from source. k8sgpt Install Clang or run brew install gcc.
```

If you install gcc as suggested, the problem will persist. Therefore, you need to install the build-essential package.

```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

### Failing Installation on WSL or Linux (missing gcc)
  When installing Homebrew on WSL or Linux, you may encounter the following error:

  ```
  ==> Installing k8sgpt from k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt Error: The following formula cannot be installed from a bottle and must be
  built from the source. k8sgpt Install Clang or run brew install gcc.
  ```

If you install gcc as suggested, the problem will persist. Therefore, you need to install the build-essential package.
  ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install build-essential
  ```

## Running K8sGPT through a container

If you are running K8sGPT through a container, the CLI will not be able to open the website for the OpenAI token.

You can find the latest container image for K8sGPT in the packages of the GitHub organisation: [Link](https://github.com/k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt/pkgs/container/k8sgpt)

A volume can then be mounted to the image through e.g. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/).
Below is an example:

```bash
version: '2'
services:
 k8sgpt:
   image: ghcr.io/k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt:dev-202304011623
   volumes:
     -  /home/$(whoami)/.k8sgpt.yaml:/home/root/.k8sgpt.yaml
```

## Installing the K8sGPT Operator Helm Chart

K8sGPT can be installed as an Operator inside the cluster.
For further information, see the [K8sGPT Operator](in-cluster-operator.md) documentation.

## Upgrading the brew installation

To upgrade the K8sGPT brew installation run the following command:

```bash
brew upgrade k8sgpt
```
